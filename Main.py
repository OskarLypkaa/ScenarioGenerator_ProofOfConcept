üî¥ IMPORTANT NOW
----------------
    - Determine if there is a time window between clicking a mouse/key and the action being reflected in SEE.
      If yes, we can capture more accurate 'before' and 'after' inputs.
    - In Excel generation, add auto-save after image insertion.
    - Integrate free AI models to extract more information from screenshots.
    - Use those AI models to generate action descriptions.
    - Improve click pointer on images (make it semi-transparent so it doesn't block the view).
    - Add gitignore.
    - Make API calls less expensive by correcting the question in prompt and by resizing the images
    - Try to correct Model so the results are smaller and more precised
    
üü° NOT IMPORTANT NOW
---------------------
    - Redesign code structure for readability and maintainability (apply clean code principles and read about design patterns, maybe add packages and modules).
    - Add functionality to detect a process/window created immediately after left-click.
    - Consider doing the same with key input (e.g. Enter press).
    - Implement double-click detection and step generation.
    - Right-click should also generate a step:
        - "Before" = where user right-clicked.
        - "After" = the popup that appeared.
    - Fix issue where "After" screenshot is not generated when it should be.
    - Update the package installer.

üü¢ WILL BE DONE LATER
---------------------
    - Improve description generation for clicking drawing area. Snap the values of steps that are on the bottom-right corner of SEE.
    - Add OpenAI API integration for auto-generated descriptions.
    - Create a GUI for controlling the system.
    - Create posibility to customize the shortcuts.

üîµ TO CONSIDER
---------------------
    - Automatically alternate between object/dialog view depending on what it is. 
      If it's like SEE main window, objects would be more preferable if is's small dialog, then opposite.
    - Create a GUI panel for viewing all of the actions (Screens taken).
    - Somehow integrating flaUI to fetch more data from the objects.
    - If OpenAI turns out to be too expesive maybe going for DeepSeek run locally would be a good idea.
    - Think of new python libs that could be usefull here.
